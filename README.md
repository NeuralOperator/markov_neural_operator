# Markov Neural Operator (MNO)

This repository contains the code for the paper "Learning Dissipative Dynamics in Chaotic Systems," published in NeurIPS 2022.

In this work, we propose a machine learning framework, which we call the Markov Neural Operator (MNO), to learn the underlying solution operator for dissipative chaotic systems, showing that the resulting learned operator accurately captures short-time trajectories and long-time statistical behavior. Using this framework, we are able to predict various statistics of the invariant measure for the turbulent Kolmogorov Flow dynamics with Reynolds numbers up to 5000.

## Requirements
* Neural operator code is based on the [Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)]([url](https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator)), which requires PyTorch 1.8.0 or later.

## Datasets
In our paper, we train and evaluate on datasets from the Lorenz-63 system, Kuramotoâ€“Sivashinsky equation, and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations (Kolmogorov flow).
* Lorenz:
* KS:
* Data generation for 2D Navier-Stokes is based on the data generation scripts in the [FNO repository]([url](https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator/tree/master/data_generation/navier_stokes)).
